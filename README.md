Sites Mockups (beta)
======================

Turn Google Sites File Cabinet template into a mockups-friendly experience.

Features:

  * Share mockups with your team using Google Accounts.
  * Be alterted when mockups change by receiving email notifications.
  * Access all the mockup versions to compare differences to one screen over time.
  * Leave comments for others, which will also generate emails.

How to use
======================

Go to your Balsamiq Mockups app and select File > Export All Mockups to PNG. Export them into a folder.

Go to https://sites.google.com and create a new site.

Create a page using the File Cabinet template. Select Add File on the page, and import all the PNGs that you just created.

You can now share this page with your team, and they can subscribe to file changes and leave comments.

When you have the next revision of the mockups, simply repeat the steps above. Google will override the files, but allow you to access the previous versions of the files. Note: the file names have to be left the same.

More info
======================

Number your mockups. For example, call the login screen "10 Login", register screen "20 Register" so your team can refer to the mockup by number. The two digit id is also handy if you want to insert a new screen in between. For example, you can create "11 Login - Forgot password" to illustrate how the user will deal with password recovery.
